- Templates can be updated, deleted, and viewed.

### Customer Management:

- Customers are stored with basic information such as first name, last name, creation date, and modification date.
- Customers are associated with campaigns to personalize messages.

### Campaign Management:

- Companies can create campaigns using a selected template.
- Campaigns are associated with a list of customers to personalize the message for each customer.
